Our approach is web scraping. We ask your credentials to load data from LATTE. Account data will be encrypted server-side.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\nEach assignment takes about one second to load, which is relatively slow. However we offer real-time progress feedback and background processing. That means your web page will not be refreshing while waiting data to load, and LATTE data can be loaded through scheduling spare time.\r\n\r\n### Background processing\r\nWe use ActiveJob and sidekiq to concurrently proceed LATTE data asynchronously. Multiple loading tasks will not slow down the process.\r\n\r\n### Redis server\r\nRedis in-memory caching service is used to improve performance.",
